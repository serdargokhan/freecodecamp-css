                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures
                    and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
                    typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid
                    application development in many areas on most platforms.The Python interpreter and the extensive
                    standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python
                    Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains
                    distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
                    additional documentation.</p>

                <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For
                    example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and
                    rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom
                    database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically
                    much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
                    <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
                    <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>More Control Flow Tools</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Besides the while statement just introduced, Python uses the usual flow control statements known from
                    other languages, with some twists.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        if x < 0: <br>
                            ... x = 0 <br>
                            ... print('Negative changed to zero') <br>
                            ... elif x == 0: <br>
                            ... print('Zero') <br>
                            ... elif x == 1: <br>
                            ... print('Single') <br>
                            ... else: <br>
                            ... print('More') <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always
                    iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to
                    define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the
                    items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example
                    (no pun intended):</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        >>> # Measure some strings: <br>
                        ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br>
                        >>> for w in words: <br>
                        ... print(w, len(w)) <br>
                        ... <br>
                        cat 3 <br>
                        window 6 <br>
                        defenestrate 12 <br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the
                    program requires no action. For example:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        >>> while True: <br>
                        ... pass # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) <br>
                        ...
                    </code>
                </div>
                <p>We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        >>> def fib(n): # write Fibonacci series up to n <br>
                        ... """Print a Fibonacci series up to n.""" <br>
                        ... a, b = 0, 1 <br>
                        ... while a < n: <br>
                            ... print(a, end=' ') <br>
                            ... a, b = b, a+b <br>
                            ... print() <br>
                            ... <br>
                            >>> # Now call the function we just defined: <br>
                            ... fib(2000) <br>
                            0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 <br>

                </header>
                <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and
                    variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using
                    a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead.
                    This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several
                    files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several
                    programs without copying its definition into each program.</p>
                <div class="code-container">
                    <code>
                        # Fibonacci numbers module <br>

                </header>
                <p>There are several ways to present the output of a program; data can be printed in a human-readable form,
                    or written to a file for future use. This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To use formatted string literals, begin a string with f or F before the opening quotation mark or
                        triple quotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between { and }
                        characters that can refer to variables or literal values.</li>
                    <li>The str.format() method of strings requires more manual effort. You’ll still use { and } to mark
                        where a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also
                        need to provide the information to be formatted.</li>
                    <li>Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation
                        operations to create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform
                        useful operations for padding strings to a given column width.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes,
                    you can convert any value to a string with the repr() or str() functions.</p>
