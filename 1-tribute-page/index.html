            <h3>Freud's ideas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Freud began his study of medicine at the University of Vienna at the age of 17. He got his M.D.
                    degree in 1881 at the age of 25 and entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons.
                </li>
                <li>As a medical researcher, Freud was an early user and proponent of cocaine as a stimulant as well as
                    analgesic. He wrote several articles on the antidepressant qualities of the drug and he was
                    influenced by friend and confidant Wilhelm Fliess, who recommended cocaine for the treatment of
                    "nasal reflex neurosis".</li>
                <li>Freud made arguments about the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought
                    and behavior.</li>
                <li>Freud hoped his model was universally valid and so turned to ancient mythology and ethnography for
                    comparative material. </li>
                <li>Freud believed that humans were driven by two conflicting central desires: the life drive which is
                    called "Eros"</li>
                <li>The Super-ego is the moral component of the psyche, which makes a clear distinction between right
                    and wrong, and makes no allowance for special circumstances. </li>
                <li>The term Id ('the It' or 'the Thing') represents the primitive urges to possess, conquer, dominate
                    and achieve pleasure.</li>
                <li>The term Ego entered the English language in the late 18th century. </li>
                <li>He used the Oedipus conflict to point out how much he believed that people desire incest and must
                    repress that desire.</li>
                <li>One key factor in the operation of the unconscious is 'repression'. Freud believed that many people
                    repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>“Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.”
